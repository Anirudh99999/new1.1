hello new file it wils 


To convert a .pem file to a .ppk file that can be used in PuTTY, you can follow these steps:

Download and install the PuTTY Key Generator (PuTTYgen) from the official website.
Open PuTTYgen and click on the "Load" button.
In the "Load Private Key" dialog box, change the file type filter to "All Files (.)".
Navigate to the location of your .pem file, select it, and click on the "Open" button.
PuTTYgen will show a message that it has successfully imported the key, click on the "OK" button.
Click on the "Save private key" button to save the key in the .ppk format.
A warning message will appear informing you that the key will be saved without a passphrase. Click on the "Yes" button to confirm.
Choose a name for the .ppk file and save it to a location of your choice.
Once you have created the .ppk file, you can use it to connect to your EC2 instance in PuTTY by following the steps I outlined in my previous answer.

how to install git in install 
To install Git on an EC2 instance running a Linux-based operating system, you can follow these steps:

Connect to your instance using SSH (e.g., using PuTTY as described in my previous answer).

Run the following command to update the package index and make sure that the system is up-to-date:

sql
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
Run the following command to install Git:

csharp
Copy code
sudo apt-get install git
Once the installation is complete, verify that Git was installed by running the following command:

css
Copy code
git --version
This should display the version number of Git that was installed.

That's it! You now have Git installed on your EC2 instance and can use it for version control, code collaboration, and more.
